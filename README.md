# Ian Marquez's personal CMS

This is a personal project I have decided to undergo in my journey of reviving
my personal website. This is running [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/) and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
under the hood.

## Running the Application

1. Run pocketbase dev locally using the command
   `./backend/pocketbase serve`
1. Run front end using the command.
   `cd frontend
 yarn dev
`
1. This should return the admin urls and site urls of the project and should be good to go.
